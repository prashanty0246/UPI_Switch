UPI (Unified Payments Interface) issuer switch is a system that enables transactions between different UPI applications or banks. It acts as an intermediary that facilitates communication between various banks and UPI apps, allowing them to send and receive funds through the UPI network.

Here is how the UPI issuer switch works:

   1. Customer initiates a transaction: The customer initiates a UPI transaction from their mobile app, specifying the amount and the recipient's UPI ID or account details.

   2. UPI app sends transaction details: The UPI app sends the transaction details to the customer's bank.

   3. Bank sends request to the UPI issuer switch: The customer's bank sends a request to the UPI issuer switch, which acts as an intermediary between banks and UPI apps.

   4. UPI issuer switch validates the transaction: The UPI issuer switch validates the transaction and checks if the customer's account has sufficient balance to complete the transaction.

   5. UPI issuer switch sends transaction details to recipient bank: If the transaction is valid, the UPI issuer switch sends the transaction details to the recipient bank.

   6. Recipient bank confirms the transaction: The recipient bank confirms the transaction and sends a message to the UPI issuer switch.

   7. UPI issuer switch sends confirmation to customer's bank: The UPI issuer switch sends the confirmation to the customer's bank, which in turn sends a notification to the customer's UPI app about the successful transaction.

   8. Customer receives notification: The customer receives a notification about the transaction being completed successfully.
